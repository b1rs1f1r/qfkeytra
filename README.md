# Q-F Keyboard Transform

## Introduction
You can transform Q keyboard to F easily.
I think this can be a good cryptical messaging.
Don't forget look my another project, F-Q Keyboard Transform.

## How to Run
First, you must have python 3. You can install from its website.
Than, unzip the program to anywhere. In this folder, you must open terminal or cmd.
After that, type "python/python3 'file name and extension(.py)'".

That's it!
